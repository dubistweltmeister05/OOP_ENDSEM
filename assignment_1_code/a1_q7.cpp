Inheritance

Polymorphism

1.

It is a part of object-oriented programming paradigm.

'Poly' means multiple and 'morph' means forms.

2.

It can be implemented in C++, Java, Python, and other object-oriented programming languages.

It is a part of object-oriented programming paradigm.

3.

It is the method in which a new class is created that can take and use the properties of an already existing class.

It can be implemented in C++, Java, Python, and other object-oriented programming languages.

4.

The already existing class is known as 'parent/base class' and the class that uses this class is known as 'child/derived class'.

Hence, polymorphism refers to the method of performing a specific task in multiple ways.

5.

It helps reuse the code.

This can be used while using functions.

6.

It reduces the size of the code while implementing object oriented programming.

It allows the object of the class to decide which form it has to take to work with methods and attributes of the class.

Types of polymorphism

Compile-time polymorphism- It is also known as method overloading.

Run-time polymorphism- It is also known as method overriding.

8.

It can be used in pattern design.
